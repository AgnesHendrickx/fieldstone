I wish to provide the community with:
\begin{itemize}
\item an enormous bibliography data base - simply search the pdf for keywords. The \LaTeX bib
 file is also available next to the manual.tex file on github;  
\item a go-to document for anybody who wants to know more about 
      a particular topic in computational geodynamics;
\item a useful teaching tool for researchers, teachers, students and PhD students alike; 
\item small, readable, educative codes. 
\end{itemize}
