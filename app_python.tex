Python is touted as the one language students should learn and master. However it is a language which allows *way* too much liberty in its syntax and encourages students to be sloppy. 

For instance the following code runs just fine:

\begin{lstlisting}
for k in range(0,5): 
    for k in range(0,5):
        for k in range(0,5):
            print (k)
\end{lstlisting}

This alone should disqualify this language. It is easy to see the obvious problem with this code, but adding a few lines of code in between each 'for' line hides the problem and the absence of any warning makes this code a nightmare to debug.
