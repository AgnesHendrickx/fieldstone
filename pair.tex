The success of a mixed finite element formulation crucially depends on a proper choice of the local interpolations of the velocity and the pressure.

\subsubsection{Families}

\index{Taylor-Hood}

The family of \underline{Taylor-Hood} finite element spaces on triangular/tetrahedral 
grids is given by $P_k \times P_{k-1}$ with $k\geq 2$, 
and on quadrilateral/hexahedral grids by $Q_k \times Q_{k-1}$ with $k\geq 2$.
This means that the pressure is then approximated by continuous functions. 

These finite elements are very popular, in particular the pairs for $k=2$, i.e.
$Q_2\times Q_1$ and $P_2\times P_1$.
The reason why $k\geq 2$ comes from the fact that the 
$Q_1 \times Q_0$ (i.e. $Q_1 \times P_0$) and $P_2\times P_1$
are not stable elements (they are not inf-sup stable). 

\begin{remark}
Note that a similar element to $Q_2 \times Q_1$ has been proposed
and used succesfully used \cite{taho73,hota74}: it is denoted by $Q_2^{(8)} \times Q_1$ 
since the center node ('$x^2y^2$') and its associated degrees of freedom have been removed. It 
has also been proved to be LBB stable.

discussed in example 3.71 of \cite{john16}

However simple it may look, the \index{$Q_1 \times P_0$} element is 
one of the hardest elements to analyze and many questions are still open about its properties. 
The element does not satisfy the inf-sup condition \cite{hugh}p211. 
In \cite{grsa} it is qualified as follows: slightly unstable but highly usable. 

The $Q_1 \times P_0$ mixed approximation is the lowest order conforming approximation 
method defined on a rectangular grid. It also happens to be the most famous example 
of an unstable mixed approximation method.
\cite[p235]{elsw}.

This element is discussed in \cite{fort81}, \cite{fofo85} and in \cite{pisa85} 
in the context of multigrid use.

This element is plagued by so-called pressure checkerboard modes which
have been thoroughly analysed \cite{grsi94}, \cite{chpc95}, \cite{sagl81a,sagl81b}.
These can be filtered out \cite{chpc95}. Smoothing techniques are also discussed in \cite{legs79}.

\subsubsection{The bi/tri-quadratic velocity - discontinuous linear pressure element ($Q_2 \times P_{-1}$)}

This element is crowned "probably the most accurate 2D element" in \cite{grsa}.

Piecewise Biquadratic velocities, piecewise linear discontinuous polynomial pressure. 
The element satisfies the inf-sup condition \cite{hugh}p211.
It is used in \cite{vssj89}. 
See \cite{boga02} over the two possible choices for the definition of the pressure space..
It is mentioned in \cite{kaus10}, \cite{boga02}, \cite{pefc89}. It is used in \cite{freh14}
to study 3D fold growth rates (see online supplementary material) and in \cite{schm08}.

Note that the serendipity version of this pair, i.e. $Q_2^{(20)}\times P_{-1}$ is also LBB stable

\subsubsection{The MINI triangular element ($P_1^+\times P_1$) in 2D}
\label{pair:mini}

The \index{MINI element} MINI element was first introduced in Arnold et al, 1984 \cite{arbf84}.
It is also discussed in section 3.6.1 of \cite{john16}.
It is schematically represented hereunder:

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=8cm]{images/mini/minielement}\\
{\small Figure taken from Donea and Huerta \cite{dohu03}}
\end{center}

\begin{remark}
Note that \cite{frol03} propose an equal-order-linear-continuous velocity-pressure variables which is enriched 
with velocity {\it and} pressure bubble functions to model the Stokes problem. They show by static condensation that
these bubble functions give rise to a stabilized method involving least-squares forms of the momentum and of the
continuity equations. In some cases their approach recovers the MINI element. Also check \cite{gamt08}.
\end{remark}

\begin{remark}
According to Braess\cite{braess}, since the support of the bubble is restricted to the element, 
the associated variable (dofs living on the bubble) can be eliminated from the resulting 
system of linear equations by static condensation. \index{Static Condensation}
Also, the MINI element is cheaper than the Taylor-Hood element but it is commonly accepted
that it yields a poorer approximation of the pressure.
\end{remark}

The 3D MINI element is not very common but it is used for instance in \cite{pico98}.
It is also said to be LBB stable in \cite[p180]{reddybook2}.

\subsubsection{The quadratic velocity - linear pressure triangle ($P_2\times P_1$)}

From \cite{segal}: \say{Taylor-Hood elements \cite{taho73} 
are characterized by the fact that the pressure is continuous in the region $\Omega$. 
A typical example is the quadratic triangle (P2P1 element).
In this element the velocity is approximated by a quadratic polynomial and the pressure by a
linear polynomial. One can easily verify that both approximations are continuous over 
the element boundaries.}
It can be shown, Segal (1979), that this element is admissible if at least 3 elements 
are used. The quadrilateral counterpart of this triangle is the $Q_2\times Q_1$ element.
Reddy and Gartling \cite[p179]{reddybook2} also report this element to be LBB stable.




%----------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsubsection{The Crouzeix-Raviart triangle ($P_2^+\times P_{-1}$)}
\label{sec:crouzeix-raviart}

Since the $P_2\times P_{-1}$ pair is not LBB stable \cite[p179]{reddybook2}, 
it is enhanced by a cubic bubble and is therefore called $P_2^+\times P_{-1}$. 

This element was first introduced in \cite{crra73}.
It is the element used in the MILAMIN code \cite{daks08}.
It is a seven-node triangle with quadratic velocity shape 
functions enhanced by a cubic bubble function and discontinuous linear interpolation for 
the pressure field \cite{cuss86}. 
This element is LBB stable and no additional stabilization techniques are required\cite{elsw}.
The '+' in its name stands for the bubble while the '-' stands for the discontinuous
character of the pressure field: once again, it is $P_1$ over the element, but discontinuous
across element edges.

\begin{remark}
Cuvelier et al, 1986 \cite{cuss86} recommend a 6-point or 7-point quadrature rule for this element.
\end{remark}

\begin{remark}
Segal \cite{segal} explains 
for output purposes (printing, plotting etc.) the discontinuous pressures are averaged 
in vertices for all the adjoining elements. See also Fig. 7.3 of \cite{cuss86}.
\end{remark}

\begin{remark}
The simplest Crouzeix-Raviart element is the non-conforming linear triangle 
with constant pressure ($P_1\times P_0$) \cite{cuss86}. 
\end{remark}

It is worth noting that this element has more degrees of freedom  than the 
Taylor-Hood element for the same order of accuracy. However, since the 
bubble can be eliminated, one can design a modified version of this element.
\todo[inline]{Check Cuvelier book chapter 8 for modified element}


\begin{remark}
I have once asked the (main) author of MILAMIN why he chose this element, for 
example over the $P_2\times P_1$. His answer is as follows:
"Elements with continuous pressure  are incapable of converging in the Linf 
norm for mechanical problems exhibiting pressure jumps such as the inclusion-host setup. 
During my MSc and PhD I was focusing on sharp heterogeneities, so this is why I decided 
to choose $P_2^+\times P_{-1}$. 
You will see that it is also easy to invert the pressure mass matrix for such elements, 
which is really useful (both for the augmentation and preconditioning)."
\end{remark}

This element is used by Poliakov and Podlachikov \cite{popo92} to study the deformation of the surface above a rising diapir. Note that they actually use a "13 point integration formula (Hughes
1987) for calculation of the stiffness matrix was used in order
t o conserve detailed information from the marker field in
the coarse FEM mesh". 
It is also used in \cite{anmp15} in the context of a new free-surface stabilization scheme. 
It is the element used in LaCoDe \cite{demh19}.

\subsubsection{A note about incompressibility and standard mixed methods}

What follows is nicely explained and demonstrated in John et al \cite{jolm17}. In their 
example 1.1 they look at the velocity error of benchmark VJ2 (see Section~\ref{mms9}) 
which analytical solution is a zero velocity field. They show that for the MINI, 
Taylor-Hood and Crouzeix-Raviart triangular elements the velocity error grows 
with the magnitude of the rhs. They also make this statement:
\say{
there are important applications, e.g., natural
convection problems, where the pressure is larger than the velocity by orders
of magnitude. In such situations, one cannot expect to compute accurate
velocity fields with classical mixed methods, at least for low order methods.
