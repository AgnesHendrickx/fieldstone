The success of a mixed finite element formulation crucially depends on a proper choice of the local interpolations of the velocity and the pressure.

\subsection{The compatibility condition (or LBB condition)}
\index{LBB} \index{optimal rate}

'LBB stable' elements assure the existence of a unique solution 
and assure convergence at the optimal rate.

\subsection{Families}

\index{Taylor-Hood}

The family of Taylor-Hood finite element spaces on triangular/tetrahedral 
grids is given by $P_k \times P_{k-1}$ with $k\geq 2$, 
and on quadrilateral/hexahedral grids by $Q_k \times Q_{k-1}$ with $k\geq 2$.
This means that the pressure is then approximated by continuous functions. 

These finite elements are very popular, in particular the pairs for $k=2$, i.e.
$Q_2\times Q_1$ and $P_2\times P_1$.
The reason why $k\geq 2$ comes from the fact that the 
$Q_1 \times Q_0$ (i.e. $Q_1 \times P_0$) and $P_2\times P_1$
are not stable elements (they are not inf-sup stable). 

\begin{remark}
Note that a similar element to $Q_2 \times Q_1$ has been proposed
and used succesfully used \cite{taho73,hota74}: it is denoted by $Q_2^{(8)} \times Q_1$ 
since the center node ('$x^2y^2$') and its associated degrees of freedom have been removed. It 
has also been proved to be LBB stable.

\subsection{The quadratic velocity - linear pressure triangle ($P_2\times P_1$)}
\includegraphics[width=3cm]{images/under_construction}

From \cite{segal}.
Taylor-Hood elements (Taylor and Hood 1973) 
are characterized by the fact that the pressure is continuous in the region $\Omega$. 
A typical example is the quadratic triangle (P2P1 element).
In this element the velocity is approximated by a quadratic polynomial and the pressure by a
linear polynomial. One can easily verify that both approximations are continuous over 
the element boundaries. 
It can be shown, Segal (1979), that this element is admissible if at least 3 elements 
are used. The quadrilateral counterpart of this triangle is the $Q_2\times Q_1$ element.

\subsection{The Crouzeix-Raviart triangle ($P_2^+\times P_{-1}$)}
\includegraphics[width=3cm]{images/under_construction}

From \cite{daks08}: seven-node Crouzeix-Raviart triangle with quadratic velocity shape functions enhanced by a cubic bubble function and discontinuous linear interpolation for the pressure field [e.g., Cuvelier et al., 1986]. This element is stable and no additional stabilization techniques are required [Elman et al., 2005].

From \cite{segal}. These elements are characterized by a discontinuous pressure; 
discontinuous on element boundaries. 
For output purposes (printing, plotting etc.) these discontinuous pressures are averaged 
in vertices for all the adjoining elements.

The most simple Crouzeix-Raviart element is the non-conforming linear triangle 
with constant pressure ($P_1\times P_0$).
