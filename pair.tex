The success of a mixed finite element formulation crucially depends on a proper choice of the local interpolations of the velocity and the pressure.

\subsubsection{Families}

\index{Taylor-Hood}

The family of \underline{Taylor-Hood} finite element spaces on triangular/tetrahedral 
grids is given by $P_k \times P_{k-1}$ with $k\geq 2$, 
and on quadrilateral/hexahedral grids by $Q_k \times Q_{k-1}$ with $k\geq 2$.
This means that the pressure is then approximated by continuous functions. 

These finite elements are very popular, in particular the pairs for $k=2$, i.e.
$Q_2\times Q_1$ and $P_2\times P_1$.
The reason why $k\geq 2$ comes from the fact that the 
$Q_1 \times Q_0$ (i.e. $Q_1 \times P_0$) and $P_2\times P_1$
are not stable elements (they are not inf-sup stable). 

\begin{remark}
Note that a similar element to $Q_2 \times Q_1$ has been proposed
and used succesfully used \cite{taho73,hota74}: it is denoted by $Q_2^{(8)} \times Q_1$ 
since the center node ('$x^2y^2$') and its associated degrees of freedom have been removed. It 
has also been proved to be LBB stable.

discussed in example 3.71 of \cite{john16}

However simple it may look, the \index{$Q_1 \times P_0$} element is 
one of the hardest elements to analyze and many questions are still open about its properties. 
The element does not satisfy the inf-sup condition \cite{hugh}p211. 
In \cite{grsa} it is qualified as follows: slightly unstable but highly usable. 

The $Q_1 \times P_0$ mixed approximation is the lowest order conforming approximation 
method defined on a rectangular grid. It also happens to be the most famous example 
of an unstable mixed approximation method.
\cite[p235]{elsw}.

This element is discussed in \cite{fort81}, \cite{fofo85} and in \cite{pisa85} 
in the context of multigrid use.

This element is plagued by so-called pressure checkerboard modes which
have been thoroughly analysed \cite{grsi94}, \cite{chpc95}, \cite{sagl81a,sagl81b}.
These can be filtered out \cite{chpc95}. Smoothing techniques are also discussed in \cite{legs79}.

In \cite{grsa} Gresho \& Sani write that in their opinion $div(\vec v)=0$ is not strong enough.

This element, implemented in penalised form, is discussed in \cite{been79} and the follow-up paper \cite{been80}. CHECK

\subsubsection{The MINI triangular element ($P_1^+\times P_1$) in 2D}
\label{pair:mini}

The \index{MINI element} MINI element was first introduced in Arnold et al, 1984 \cite{arbf84}.
It is also discussed in section 3.6.1 of \cite{john16}.
It is schematically represented hereunder:

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=8cm]{images/mini/minielement}\\
{\small Figure taken from Donea and Huerta \cite{dohu03}}
\end{center}

\begin{remark}
Note that \cite{frol03} propose an equal-order-linear-continuous velocity-pressure variables which is enriched 
with velocity {\it and} pressure bubble functions to model the Stokes problem. They show by static condensation that
these bubble functions give rise to a stabilized method involving least-squares forms of the momentum and of the
continuity equations. In some cases their approach recovers the MINI element. Also check \cite{gamt08}.
\end{remark}

\begin{remark}
According to Braess\cite{braess}, since the support of the bubble is restricted to the element, 
the associated variable (dofs living on the bubble) can be eliminated from the resulting 
system of linear equations by static condensation. \index{Static Condensation}
Also, the MINI element is cheaper than the Taylor-Hood element but it is commonly accepted
that it yields a poorer approximation of the pressure.
\end{remark}

The 3D MINI element is not very common but it is used for instance in \cite{pico98}.

\subsubsection{The quadratic velocity - linear pressure triangle ($P_2\times P_1$)}

From \cite{segal}.
Taylor-Hood elements (Taylor and Hood 1973) 
are characterized by the fact that the pressure is continuous in the region $\Omega$. 
A typical example is the quadratic triangle (P2P1 element).
In this element the velocity is approximated by a quadratic polynomial and the pressure by a
linear polynomial. One can easily verify that both approximations are continuous over 
the element boundaries. 
It can be shown, Segal (1979), that this element is admissible if at least 3 elements 
are used. The quadrilateral counterpart of this triangle is the $Q_2\times Q_1$ element.




%----------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsubsection{The Crouzeix-Raviart triangle ($P_2^+\times P_{-1}$)}

This element was first introduced in \cite{crra73}.
It is the element used in the MILAMIN code \cite{daks08}.
It is a seven-node triangle with quadratic velocity shape 
functions enhanced by a cubic bubble function and discontinuous linear interpolation for 
the pressure field \cite{cuss86}. 
This element is LBB stable and no additional stabilization techniques are required\cite{elsw}.

\begin{remark}
Segal \cite{segal} explains that these elements are characterized by a discontinuous pressure,
 discontinuous on element boundaries. 
For output purposes (printing, plotting etc.) these discontinuous pressures are averaged 
in vertices for all the adjoining elements.
\end{remark}

The most simple Crouzeix-Raviart element is the non-conforming linear triangle 
with constant pressure ($P_1\times P_0$). VERIFY
