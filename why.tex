The Finite Element Method (FEM) is by no means the only method 
to solve PDEs in geodynamics, nor is it necessarily the best one.
Other methods are employed very succesfully, such as the Finite Difference 
Method (FDM), the Finite Volume Method (FVM), and to a lesser extent
the Discrete Element Method (DEM) \cite{egho07,egsc07,funi14}, 
or the Element Free Galerkin Method (EFGM) \cite{hans03}.
