According to \textcite{bobf08} ``This element was apparently discovered 
around a blackboard at the Banff Conference on Finite Elements in Flow Problems (1979)''.

This element is crowned "probably the most accurate 2D element" 
in \textcite{grsa}.

It is characterised by piecewise Biquadratic velocities, 
and piecewise linear discontinuous polynomial pressure. 
The element satisfies the inf-sup condition, see page 211 of \textcite{hugh}, or 
p138 of \textcite{elsw}.
It is used in \textcite{vavs89} (1989) for steady laminar flow in a curved tube. 

See \textcite{boga02} (2002) 
for the two possible choices for the two definitions of the pressure space (mapped and un-mapped), 
and check \stone~76 for their implementation.
\textcite{bobf08} state: ``On a general quadrilateral mesh, the [pressure] space 
can be defined in two different ways: either [it] 
consists of (discontinuous) piecewise linear functions, or it is built
by considering three linear shape functions on the reference unit square and mapping
them to the general elements like it is usually done for continuous finite elements. [...]
We shall refer to the first possibility as unmapped pressure approach and to the
second one as mapped pressure approach.''
Furthermore they state ``So far, we have shown that either the unmapped and the mapped pressure 
approach gives rise to a stable $Q_2\times P_{-1}$ scheme. However, as a consequence of the
results proved in \textcite{arbf02} (2002), we have that the mapped pressure approach cannot achieve 
optimal approximation order. Namely, the unmapped pressure space provides a second-order convergence 
in $L_2$, while the mapped one achieves only ${\cal O}(h)$ in the same norm.''
See also discussion about mapped/unmapped in \textcite{bobf13}.

This element is mentioned in \textcite{kaus10} (2010) and \textcite{pefc89} (1989) 
and it is used in \textcite{freh14} (2014) to study 3D fold growth rates 
(see online supplementary material) and in \textcite{schm08} (2008).

Note that the serendipity version of this pair, i.e. $Q_2^{(20)}\times P_{-1}$ is also LBB stable
as shown in p180 of Reddy \cite{reddybook2}.
