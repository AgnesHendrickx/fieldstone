This element is crowned "probably the most accurate 2D element" 
in Gresho \& Sani \cite{grsa}.

It is characterised by piecewise Biquadratic velocities, 
and piecewise linear discontinuous polynomial pressure. 
The element satisfies the inf-sup condition, see page 211 of Hughes \cite{hugh}, or 
p138 of Elman \etal \cite{elsw}.
It is used in van de Vosse \etal (1989) \cite{vavs89} for steady laminar flow in a curved tube. 

See Boffi \& Gastaldi (2002) \cite{boga02} 
for the two possible choices for the definition of the pressure space.

This element is mentioned in Kaus (2010) \cite{kaus10} and Pelletier \etal (1989) \cite{pefc89} 
and it is  used in Frehner (2014) \cite{freh14} to study 3D fold growth rates 
(see online supplementary material) and in Schmalholtz (2008) \cite{schm08}.

Note that the serendipity version of this pair, i.e. $Q_2^{(20)}\times P_{-1}$ is also LBB stable
as shown in p180 of Reddy \cite{reddybook2}.

This element is implemented in \stone~76.
