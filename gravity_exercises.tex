\subsubsection{Full sphere}

\begin{itemize}
\item In a domain of size $L\times L \times L$ compute and store the coordinates 
of $N^3$ points.
\item Compute the associated volume $dV$ of a point as a function of L and N.
\item For points inside a sphere of radius $L/2$ assign a density $\rho_0=1$ and zero otherwise.
\item Compute the gravity potential and vector components $H=10^m$ meters above the north pole 
with $m=0,1,2,3,..10$. 
\item Compare the computed quantities as a function of $H$.
\item Plot on the same graphic the analytical values. 
\item Repeat the exercise with different values of $N$. Discuss.
\end{itemize}
