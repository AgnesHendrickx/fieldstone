This element is shown in Table~3.13-2 of Gresho \& Sani's book \cite{grsa}, 
and discussed in Section~3.13.6b of the book too. It is {\it not} LBB stable
and has one chequerboard pressure mode.

Used in \textcite{grsu02} (2002) and compared with $Q_1\times P_0$, $Q_2\times P_{-1}$ and 
$Q_2\times Q_1$ for thermal cavity problem with NS equations.
