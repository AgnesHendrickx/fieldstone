The SolKz benchmark is similar to the SolCx benchmark: 
the viscosity is a function of the space coordinates too and is given by 
\[
\eta(y)=\exp(2By) \quad {\rm with} \quad B=13.8155
\]
It is not a discontinuous function but grows exponentially with the 
vertical coordinate so that its overall variation is again $10^6$. 
The forcing is again chosen by imposing a spatially variable density variation as follows:
\[
\rho(x,y)=\sin(2y) \cos(3\pi y)
\]
Free slip boundary conditions are imposed on all sides of the domain.
This benchmark too is presented in \cite{zhon96} and is studied in \cite{dumg11} and \cite{gemd13}.
