\todo[inline]{explain why our eqs are nonlinear}

Let us consider the following system of nonlinear algebraic equations:
\[
\mathbb{A}(\vec X) \cdot \vec X = \vec b(\vec X)
\]
Both matrix and right hand side depend on the solution vector $\vec X$.

For many mildly nonlinear problems, a simple successive substitution 
iteration scheme (also called Picard method) will converge to the solution
and it is given by the simple relationship:
\[
\mathbb{A}(\vec X^n) \cdot \vec X^{n+1} = \vec b(\vec X^n)
\]
where $n$ is the iteration number. 
It is easy to implement:
\begin{enumerate}
\item guess $\vec X^0$ or use the solution from previous time step
\item compute $\mathbb{A}$ and $\vec b$ with current solution vector $\vec X^{old}$
\item solve system, obtain $T^{new}$
\item check for convergence (are $\vec X^{old}$ and$\vec X^{new}$ close enough?)
\item $\vec X^{old} \leftarrow \vec X^{new}$
\item go back to 2.
\end{enumerate}

There are various ways to test whether iterations have converged. The simplest
one is to look at $\norm{\vec X^{old}-\vec X^{new} }$ (in the $L_1$, $L_2$ or maximum norm)
and assess whether this term is smaller than a given tolerance $\epsilon$. 
However this approach poses a problem: in geodynamics, if two consecutively obtained 
temperatures do not change by more than a thousandth of a Kelvin (say $\epsilon=10^{-3}$K )
we could consider that iterations have converged but looking now at velocities which 
are of the order of a cm/year (i.e. $\sim 3\cdot 10^{-11}$m/s) we would need a tolerance 
probably less than $10^{-13}$m/s. We see that using absolute values for a convergence 
criterion is a potentially dangerous affair, which is why one uses a relative 
formulation (thereby making $\epsilon$ a dimensionless parameter):
\[
\frac{\norm{\vec X^{old}-\vec X^{new}}}{\norm{\vec X^{new}}} < \epsilon
\]
Another convergence criterion is proposed by Reddy (section 3.7.2) \cite{reddybook2}:
\[
\left(
\frac{ (\vec X^{old}-\vec X^{new})\cdot(\vec X^{old}-\vec X^{new} ) }{ X^{new}\cdot X^{new}  } 
\right)^{1/2} < \epsilon
\]
Yet another convergence criterion is used in \cite{thie11}: the means $<\vec X^{old}>$, $<\vec X^{new}>$
as well as the variances $\sigma^{old}$ amd $\sigma^{new}$ are computed, followed by the 
correlation factor $R$:
\[
R= \frac{ <  (\vec X^{old}-<\vec X^{old}>)\cdot( \vec X^{new}-<\vec X^{new}> )>  }{\sqrt{\sigma^{old}\sigma^{new}}}
\]
Since the correlation is normalised, it takes values between 0
(very dissimilar velocity fields) and 1 (very similar fields). The
following convergence criterion is then used: $1-R < \epsilon$.

\todo[inline]{write about nonlinear residual}


Note that in some instances and improvement in convergence rate cane be obtained by use of a 
relaxation formula where one first solves
\[
\mathbb{A}(\vec X^n) \cdot \vec X^{\star} = \vec b(\vec X^n)
\]
and then update $\vec X^n$ as follows:
\[
\vec X^n = \gamma \vec X^n + (1-\gamma) \vec X^\star 
\quad\quad\quad
0 < \gamma \leq 1
\]
When $\gamma=1$ we recover the standard Picard iterations formula above.
