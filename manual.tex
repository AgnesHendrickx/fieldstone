\section{Introduction}

practical hands-on approach

as little as possible jargon

no mathematical proof

no optimised codes (readability over efficiency). avoiding as much as possible to have to look elsewhere.
very sequential, so unavoidable repetitions (jacobian, shape functions)

FE is one of several methods.

\section{The physical equations of Fluid Dynamics}

[from aspect manual]
We focus on the system of equations in a $d=2$- or $d=3$-dimensional
domain $\Omega$ that describes the motion of a highly viscous fluid driven
by differences in the gravitational force due to a density that depends on
the temperature. In the following, we largely follow the exposition of this
material in Schubert, Turcotte and Olson \cite{scto01}.

Specifically, we consider the following set of equations for velocity $\mathbf
u$, pressure $p$ and temperature $T$:
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:stokes-1}
  -\nabla \cdot \left[2\eta \left(\dot\varepsilon(\bm v)
                                  - \frac{1}{3}(\nabla \cdot \bm v)\mathbf 1\right)
                \right] + \nabla p &=
  \rho \bm g
  &
  & \textrm{in $\Omega$},
  \\
  \label{eq:stokes-2}
  \nabla \cdot (\rho \bm v) &= 0
  &
  & \textrm{in $\Omega$},
  \\
  \label{eq:temperature}
  \rho C_p \left(\frac{\partial T}{\partial t} + \bm v\cdot\nabla T\right)
  - \nabla\cdot k\nabla T
  &=
  \rho H
  \notag
  \\
  &\quad
  +
  2\eta
  \left(\dot\varepsilon(\bm v) - \frac{1}{3}(\nabla \cdot \bm v)\mathbf 1\right)
  :
  \left(\dot\varepsilon(\bm v) - \frac{1}{3}(\nabla \cdot \bm v)\mathbf 1\right)
  \\
  &\quad
  +\alpha T \left( \bm v \cdot \nabla p \right)
  \notag
  \\
  &\quad
  + \rho T \Delta S \left(\frac{\partial X}{\partial t} + \bm v\cdot\nabla X\right)
  &
  & \textrm{in $\Omega$},
  \notag
\end{align}
where $\dot\varepsilon(\mathbf u) = \frac{1}{2}(\nabla \mathbf u + \nabla\mathbf
u^T)$ is the symmetric gradient of the velocity (often called the
\textit{strain rate}).%

In this set of equations, \eqref{eq:stokes-1} and \eqref{eq:stokes-2}
represent the compressible Stokes equations in which $\mathbf v=\mathbf
v(\mathbf x,t)$ is the velocity field and $p=p(\mathbf x,t)$ the pressure
field. Both fields depend on space $\mathbf x$ and time $t$. Fluid flow is
driven by the gravity force that acts on the fluid and that is proportional to
both the density of the fluid and the strength of the gravitational pull.

Coupled to this Stokes system is equation \eqref{eq:temperature} for the
temperature field $T=T(\mathbf x,t)$ that contains heat conduction terms as
well as advection with the flow velocity $\mathbf v$. The right hand side
terms of this equation correspond to
\begin{itemize}
\item internal heat production for example due to radioactive decay;
\item friction heating;
\item adiabatic compression of material;
\item phase change.
\end{itemize}
The last term of the temperature equation corresponds to
the latent heat generated or consumed in the process of phase change of material. 
In what follows we will not assume that no phase change takes place so that we disregard this term 
altogether.

%---------------------------------
\subsection{the Boussinesq approximation: an Incompressible flow}

[from aspect manual]
The Boussinesq approximation assumes that the density can be
considered constant in all occurrences in the equations with the exception of
the buoyancy term on the right hand side of \eqref{eq:stokes-1}. The primary
result of this assumption is that the continuity equation \eqref{eq:stokes-2}
will now read
\[
{\bm \nabla}\cdot{\bm v} = 0
\]
This implies that the strain rate tensor is deviatoric.
Under the Boussinesq approximation, the equations are much simplified:

\begin{align}
  \label{eq:stokes-1}
  -\nabla \cdot \left[2\eta \dot\varepsilon(\bm v)
                \right] + \nabla p &=
  \rho \bm g
  &
  & \textrm{in $\Omega$},
  \\
  \label{eq:stokes-2}
  \nabla \cdot (\rho \bm v) &= 0
  &
  & \textrm{in $\Omega$},
  \\
  \label{eq:temperature}
  \rho_0 C_p \left(\frac{\partial T}{\partial t} + \bm v\cdot\nabla T\right)
  - \nabla\cdot k\nabla T
  &=
  \rho H
  &
  & \textrm{in $\Omega$}
\end{align}
Note that all terms on the rhs of the temperature equations have disappeared, with the exception 
of the source term.

These are the equations which are used and implemented in all the codes, unless otherwise
indicated.

%---------------------------------
\subsubsection{The penalty approach}

In order to impose the incompressibility constraint, two widely used procedures are available, namely the 
Lagrange multiplier method and the penalty method \cite{bathe82,hugh}. The latter is implemented in {\sc elefant}, which allows for the elimination of the pressure variable from the momentum equation (resulting in a reduction of the matrix size).%, based on a relaxation of the incompressibility constraint. 

Mathematical details on the origin and validity of the penalty approach applied to the Stokes problem can for instance be found in  \cite{cuss86}, \cite{redd82} or \cite{gunz89}.

The penalty formulation of the mass conservation equation is based on a relaxation of the incompressibility constraint and writes 
\begin{equation}
{\bm \nabla}\cdot {\bm v} + \frac{p}{\lambda} = 0 \label{penal}
\end{equation}
where $\lambda$ is the penalty parameter, that can be interpreted (and has the same dimension) as a bulk viscosity. It is 
equivalent to say that the material is weakly compressible. It can be shown that if one chooses $\lambda$ to be a 
sufficiently large number, the continuity equation $ {\bm \nabla}\cdot {\bm v} = 0$ will be approximately satisfied in the finite element solution. The value of $\lambda$ is often recommended to be 6 to 7 orders of magnitude larger than the shear viscosity \cite{dohu03,hulb79}.

%Note that Eq. (\ref{penal}) does not form the basis of the penalty method (as often implied) for the Stokes equation but is a consequence of minimising a modified functional of the problem under certain assumptions \cite{redd82}. 

Equation (\ref{penal}) can be used to eliminate the pressure in Eq. (\ref{mce2}) so that the mass and momentum conservation equations fuse to become :
\begin{equation}
{\bm \nabla}\cdot ( 2 \eta \dot\varepsilon({\bm v})) + \lambda {\bm \nabla} ({\bm \nabla }\cdot {\bm v}) = \rho {\bm g} = 0 \label{peneq}
\end{equation}

\cite{mahu78} have established the equivalence for incompressible problems between the reduced integration
of the penalty term and a mixed Finite Element approach if the pressure nodes coincide with the integration points of the reduced rule.

In the end, the elimination of the pressure unknown in the Stokes equations
replaces the original saddle-point Stokes problem \cite{begl05} by an elliptical problem, 
which leads to a symmetric positive definite (SPD) FEM matrix. 
%Such systems always admit a square root triangular matrix (the Cholesky factor, L) and can be solved, once L has been computed (Cholesky factorization), by 2 triangular matrix solves (upper and lower back-substitutions). 
This is the major benefit of the penalized approach 
over the full indefinite solver with the velocity-pressure variables. Indeed, the SPD character of the matrix lends itself 
to efficient solving stragegies and is less memory-demanding since it is sufficient to store only the upper half of the matrix including the diagonal
\cite{gova}
.
ToDo: list codes which use this approach.
