\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Philosophy} %------------------------------------------------------
This document was writing with my students in mind, i.e. 3rd and 4th year 
Geology/Geophysics students at Utrecht University. 
I have chosen to use as little jargon as possible unless it is a term that is 
commonly found in the geodynamics literature (methods paper as well as 
application papers). There is no mathematical proof of any theorem or statement 
I make. These are to be found in generic Numerical Analysic, Finite Element and 
Linear Algebra books. If you find that this books lacks references
to Sobolev spaces, Hilbert spaces, and other spaces, this book is just not for you.  

The codes I provide here are by no means optimised as I value code readability 
over code efficiency. I have also chosen to avoid resorting to multiple code 
files or even functions to favour a sequential reading of the codes. 
These codes are not designed to form the basis of a real life application:
Existing open source highly optimised codes shoud be preferred, such as 
ASPECT \cite{krhb12,hedg17}, CITCOM, LAMEM, PTATIN, PYLITH, ... 

All kinds of feedback is welcome on the text (grammar, typos, ...) or on the 
code(s). You will have my eternal gratitude if you wish to contribute an 
example, a benchmark, a cookbook. 

All the python scripts and this document are freely available at

\subsection{Acknowledgments} %-------------------------------------------------

I have benefitted from many discussions, lectures, tutorials, coffee machine 
discussions, debugging sessions, conference poster sessions, etc ... 
over the years. I wish to name these instrumental people in particular and 
in alphabetic order: 
Wolfgang Bangerth, 
Jean Braun, 
Rens Elbertsen,
Philippe Fullsack, 
Menno Fraters, 
Anne Glerum,
Timo Heister,
Robert Myhill,
John Naliboff,
E. Gerry Puckett,
Melchior Schuh-Senlis,
Lukas van de Wiel,
Arie van den Berg, 
Tom Weir,
and the whole ASPECT family/team. 

%I wish to acknowledge many BSc and MSc students for their questions and feedback.
%and wish to mention: Job Mos (the
%very first version of fieldstone was part of his MSc thesis), 
%Tom Weir (contributions to the compressible formulation - MSc thesis), 
%and Rens Elbertsen (Tosi benchmark - BSc thesis).

\subsection{Installation}

If numpy, scipy or matplotlib are not installed on your machine, here is how you 
can install them:
\begin{verbatim}
python3.6 -m pip install --user numpy scipy matplotlib
\end{verbatim}
To install the umfpack solver:
\begin{verbatim}
pip install --upgrade scikit-umfpack --user
\end{verbatim}


\subsection{What is a fieldstone?} %-------------------------------------------
Simply put, it is stone collected from the surface of fields where it 
occurs naturally. It also stands for the bad acronym: {\sl fi}nite 
{\sl el}ement {\sl d}eformation of {\sl stone}s which echoes the primary 
application of these codes: geodynamic modelling.
