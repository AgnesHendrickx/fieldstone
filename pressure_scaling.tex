\index{pressure scaling}

As perfectly explained in the step 32 of deal.ii\footnote{https://www.dealii.org/9.0.0/doxygen/deal.II/step\_32.html},
we often need to scale the $\G$ term since it is many orders of magnitude smaller than $\K$, 
which introduces large inaccuracies in the solving process to the point that the solution is nonsensical. 
This scaling coefficient is $\eta/L$. 
We start from 
\[
\left(
\begin{array}{cc}
\K & \G \\ \G^T & 0 
\end{array}
\right)
\cdot
\left(
\begin{array}{c}
{\cal V} \\ {\cal P}
\end{array}
\right)
=
\left(
\begin{array}{c}
 f \\ h
\end{array}
\right)
\]
and introduce the scaling coefficient as follows (which in fact does not alter the solution at all):
\[
\left(
\begin{array}{cc}
\K & \frac{\eta}{L}\G \\ \frac{\eta}{L}\G^T & 0 
\end{array}
\right)
\cdot
\left(
\begin{array}{c}
{\cal V} \\\frac{L}{\eta} {\cal P}
\end{array}
\right)
=
\left(
\begin{array}{c}
 f \\ \frac{\eta}{L} h
\end{array}
\right)
\]
We then end up with the modified Stokes system:
\[
\left(
\begin{array}{cc}
\K & \underline{\G} \\ \underline{\G}^T & 0 
\end{array}
\right)
\cdot
\left(
\begin{array}{c}
{\cal V} \\ \underline{\cal P}
\end{array}
\right)
=
\left(
\begin{array}{c}
 f \\ \underline{h}
\end{array}
\right)
\]
where 
\[
\underline{\G}=\frac{\eta}{L}\G
\quad\quad
\quad\quad
\underline{\cal P}=\frac{L}{\eta} {\cal P}
\quad\quad
\quad\quad
\underline{h}=\frac{\eta}{L}h
\]
After the solve phase, we recover the real pressure with ${\cal P}=\frac{\eta}{L}{\cal P}'$.
