Let $\Omega$ be the disc with the center (0,0( and the radius 1 which has a crack
along the $x-$axis between the points (0,0) and (1,0).
\[
\vec\upnu(x,y) = \frac32 \sqrt{r} \left( \cos\frac{\theta}{2} -\cos \frac{3\theta}{2} , 
3\sin\frac{\theta}{2} -\sin \frac{3\theta}{2} \right)
\]
\[
p(x,y)=-\frac{6}{\sqrt{r}} \cos\frac{\theta}{2}
\]
Viscosity is 1. Note that the solution has a singularity 
in the origin.
