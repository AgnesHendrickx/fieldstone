If the paper is a single-author paper, say by Garfield, published in 1978, its code 
in my bibliography file is {\sl garf78} (i.e. the first four letters of the name, followed by 
the two digits of the publication year).

If the paper was written by two authors, say Garfield and Odie, in 1987, its code 
will be {\sl gaod87}, i.e. the first two letters of the first author followed by the two 
first letters of the second author followed by two digits.

If the paper was written by three or more authors, say Garfield, Odie, John and Irene in 
2003, its code will be {\sl gaoj03}, i.e. the first two letters of the first author followed 
by the first letter of the second author, the first letter of the third author and the year.

\begin{remark} Dutch names such as 'van Hunen' or 'van den Berg' are classified under letter 'v', 
not 'h' or 'd' nor 'b'.
