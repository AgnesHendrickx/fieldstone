When Dirichlet boundary conditions are imposed everywhere on the boundary, pressure is only present by its gradient in 
the equations. It is thus determined up to an arbitrary constant. 
In such a case, one commonly impose the average of the pressure over the whole domain or on a subsect of the boundary 
to be have a zero average, i.e.
\[
\int_\Omega p dV = 0
\]
Another possibility is to impose the pressure value at a single node. 

Let us assume that we are using $Q_1 \times P_0$ elements. Then the pressure is constant 
inside each element. 
The integral above becomes:
\[
\int_\Omega p dV = 
\sum_e  \int_{\Omega_e} p dV = 
\sum_e  p_e \int_{\Omega_e} dV = 
\sum_e  p_e A_e = 
\]
where the sum runs over all elements $e$ of area $A_e$.
This can be rewritten 
\[
\LLL^T {\cal P}=0
\] 
and it is a constraint on the pressure. As we have seen before \ref{XXX}, we can associate to it a 
Lagrange multiplier $\lambda$ so that we must solve the modified Stokes system:
\[
\left(
\begin{array}{ccc}
\K & \G & 0\\ 
\G^T & 0 & \LLL \\
0 & \LLL^T & 0
\end{array}
\right)
\cdot
\left(
\begin{array}{c}
{\cal V} \\ {\cal P} \\ \lambda
\end{array}
\right)
=
\left(
\begin{array}{c}
 f \\ h \\ 0
\end{array}
\right)
\]
When higher order spaces are used for pressure (continuous or discontinuous)
one must then carry out the above integration numerically by means of (usually)
a Gauss-Legendre quadrature.
