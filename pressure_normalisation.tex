\subsubsection{Basic idea and naive implementation}

When Dirichlet boundary conditions are imposed everywhere on the boundary, pressure is only present by its gradient in 
the equations. It is thus determined up to an arbitrary constant (one speaks then of a null space of size 1).  
In such a case, one commonly impose the average of the pressure over the whole domain or on a subsect of the boundary 
to be have a zero average, i.e.
\[
\int_\Omega p dV = 0
\]
Another possibility is to impose the pressure value at a single node. 

Let us assume that we are using $Q_1 \times P_0$ elements. Then the pressure is constant 
inside each element. 
The integral above becomes:
\[
\int_\Omega p dV = 
\sum_e  \int_{\Omega_e} p dV = 
\sum_e  p_e \int_{\Omega_e} dV = 
\sum_e  p_e A_e = 0
\]
where the sum runs over all elements $e$ of area $A_e$.
This can be rewritten 
\[
\LLL^T \cdot \vec{\cal P}=0
\] 
and it is a constraint on the pressure solution. 
As we have seen before \ref{XXX}, we can associate to it a 
Lagrange multiplier $\lambda$ so that we must solve the modified Stokes system:
\[
\left(
\begin{array}{ccc}
\K & \G & 0\\ 
\G^T & 0 & \LLL \\
0 & \LLL^T & 0
\end{array}
\right)
\cdot
\left(
\begin{array}{c}
\vec{\cal V} \\ \vec{\cal P} \\ \lambda
\end{array}
\right)
=
\left(
\begin{array}{c}
\vec{f} \\ \vec{h} \\ 0
\end{array}
\right)
\]
When higher order spaces are used for pressure (continuous or discontinuous)
one must then carry out the above integration numerically by means of (usually)
a Gauss-Legendre quadrature.

Although valid, this approach has one main disadvantage: it makes the Stokes matrix larger (although
marginally so -- only one row and column are added), but more importantly it prevents the use of some
of the solving strategies of Section \ref{solvers}.

\subsubsection{Implementation -- the real deal}

The idea is actually quite simple and requires two steps:
\begin{enumerate}
\item remove the null space by prescribing the pressure at one location and solve the system;
\item post-process the pressure so as to arrive at a pressure field which fulfills the required normalisation (surface, volume, ...)
\end{enumerate}
