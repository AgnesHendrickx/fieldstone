The $n+1$ Bernstein basis polynomials of degree $n$ on the interval $[0,1]$
are defined as \footnote{\url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernstein_polynomial}}
\index{general}{Bernstein Polynomials}
\[
b_{m,n}(x) = \left( \begin{array}{c} n \\ m \end{array}\right) x^m(1-x)^{n-m}
\qquad m=0,1,...n
\]
The first few Bernstein polynomials are 
\begin{eqnarray}
b_{0,0}(x) &=& 1 \\
b_{0,1}(x) &=& 1-x \nn\\
b_{1,1}(x) &=& x \\
b_{0,2}(x) &=& (1-x)^2 \nn\\
b_{1,2}(x) &=& 2x(1-x) \nn\\
b_{2,2}(x) &=& x^2 
\end{eqnarray}

We see that the zero-th and first order polynomials are the same as the linear shape functions defined in 
Section~\ref{sec:elts1D}. However the second order polynomials (and higher) differ from the second-order
shape functions. 

Also, the Bernstein polynomials have a lot of properties, but one that is of importance to us
is the following: $b_{m,n}(x) \geq 0 \quad  \forall x\in [0,1]$, i.e. the polynomials 
are positive. This is however not true for shape functions for $n\geq 2$.
Another important property shared with shape functions is that their sum over the interval is 
exactly 1, i.e. $\sum_m b_{m,n}(x)=1$.

In order to facilitate the comparison between the 2nd-order shape functions and Bernstein 
polynomials, I will express the latter as a function of the reduced coordinate
$r\in[-1,1]=2(x-1/2)$ (or $x=(r+1)/2$). We have then:

\begin{eqnarray}
b_{0,2}(r) &=& \frac{1}{4}(1-r)^2 \nn\\
b_{1,2}(r) &=& \frac{1}{2}(1-r^2) \nn\\
b_{2,2}(r) &=& \frac{1}{4}(1+r)^2
\end{eqnarray}

Both 2nd-order Bernstein polynomials and shape functions are plotted here under:

Having reached this point, the burning question is why should we care? 
In order to answer this question, let us carry out the following 
experiment: each node $i$ in the element carries a field value $f_i$ and for simplicity, 
we choose $f_0=f(r=-1)=1$, $f_1=f(r=0)=0$, $f_2=f(r=+1)=0$.
Then, we can compute the value of the field inside of the element 
as we usually do in the FE methodology:
\[
f^h(r) = \sum_{i=0}^2 f_i N_i(r) = f_0 N_0(r) = N_0(r) = \frac{1}{2}r(r-1)
\]
This means that although the field $f$ is always positive (or null) inside the element
its representation with the shape functions is negative over half (!) of the element
(see purple curve on the right panel above).
If we now turn to the Bernstein polynomials:
\[
f^h(r) = \sum_{i=0}^2 b_{i,2} = b_{0,2} = \frac{1}{4}(1-r)^2
\]
which is {\it always} positive over the interval $[-1,+1]$, 
and looking at the purple curve on the left panel above, 
we see that the value decreases monotonously when we go away from node 1, and reaches 
zero at the other end of the element. 

Let us now explore another aspect of such an interpolation based on the Bernstein polynomials
and assume that $f(r)=C$. Then 
\[
f^h(r) = \sum_{i=0}^2 f_i b_{i,2}(r) = C \sum_{i=0}^2 b_{i,2}(r) = C \cdot 1 = C
\]
Such interpolation can exactly represent a constant field. 
Let us assume that $f(r)=ar+b$. Then 
\begin{eqnarray}
f^h(r) 
&=& \sum_{i=0}^2 f(r_i) b_{i,2}(r)  \nn\\
&=& \sum_{i=0}^2 (ar_i+b) b_{i,2}(r) \nn\\
&=& a\sum_{i=0}^2 r_i b_{i,2}(r) + b \sum_{i=1}^3 b_{i,2}(r) \nn\\
&=& a (-b_{0,2}(r)+b_{2,2}(r)) + b \cdot 1 \nn\\
&=& ar+b 
\end{eqnarray}
Such interpolation can exactly represent a linear field. 

Let us assume that $f(r)=ar^2+br+c$. Then 
\begin{eqnarray}
f^h(r) 
&=& \sum_{i=0}^2 f(r_i) b_{i,2}(r) \nn \\
&=& \sum_{i=0}^2 (ar^2+br+c) b_{i,2}(r) \nn\\
&=& \sum_{i=0}^2 r_i^2 b_{i,2}(r) + b \sum_{i=0}^2 r_i b_{i,2}(r) + c \sum_{i=0}^2 b_{i,2}(r) \nn\\
&=& a\sum_{i=0}^2 r_i^2 b_{i,2}(r) + br + c \nn\\
&=& a (b_{0,2}(r) + b_{2,2}(r)) + br + c \nn\\
&=& a\frac{1}{2}(1+r^2)  + br + c 
\end{eqnarray}
which is not equal to $f(r)$.

On the other hand it is trivial to show that 
\begin{eqnarray}
f^h(r) 
&=&  \sum_{i=0}^2 f(r_i) N_i(r) \nn \\
&=&  \sum_{i=0}^2   (ar_i^2+br_i+c)  N_i(r) \nn \\
&=&  a \sum_{i=0}^2  r_i^2 N_i(r) + b \sum_{i=0}^2 r_i  N_i(r) +  c \sum_{i=0}^2  N_i(r) \nn \\
&=&  a \sum_{i=0}^2  r_i^2 N_i(r) + b \sum_{i=0}^2 r_i  N_i(r) +  c \nn\\
&=&  a (N_0(r)+N_2(r)) + b (-N_0(r) +N_2(r)) +  c \nn\\
&=&  a r^2  + b r+ c 
\end{eqnarray}

As a conclusion there is a trade-off: 2nd-order Bernstein polynomials always yield positive 
values when the field is positive (as opposed to 2nd-order shape functions) but they cannot 
represent exactly a 2nd-order polynomial field (while shape functions can).

The positivity can be really critical in geodynamical simulations: a negative density makes no sense, 
and a negative viscosity even less!

The 2nd-order Bernstein polynomials are used in Stone \ref{f64}.
