When free slip boundary conditions are prescribed in an annulus or
hollow sphere geometry there exists a rotational nullspace, or in other words there exists
a tangential velocity field ('pure rotation') which if added or subtracted to the solution 
does not alter the solution. 

As in the pressure normalisation case (see section \ref{ss_pnorm}), the solution is simple:
\begin{enumerate}
\item fix the tangential velocity at one node on a boundary, and solve the sytem (the nullspace 
has been removed)
\item post-process the solution to have the velocity field fulfill the required conditions. 
\end{enumerate}
