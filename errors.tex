What follows is written in the case of a two-dimensional model. Generalisation to
3D is trivial. What follows is mostly borrowed from \cite{thmk14}.

When measuring the order of accuracy of the primitive variables ${\bm v}$ and $p$,
it is standard to report errors in both the $L_1$ and the $L_2$ norm.
For a scalar quantity $\Psi$, the $L_1$ and $L_2$ norms are computed as
\[
||\Psi||_1 = \int_V |\Psi| dV
\quad\quad
\quad\quad
||\Psi||_2 = \sqrt{ \int_V \Psi^2 dV }
\]
For a vector quantity ${\bm k}=(k_x,k_y)$,
the $L_1$ and $L_2$ norms are defined as:
\[
||{\bm k}||_1 = \int_V (|k_x|+|k_y|) dV
\quad\quad
\quad\quad
||{\bm k}||_2 = \sqrt{ \int_V (k_x^2+k_y^2) dV }
\]

To compute the respective norms
the integrals in the above norms can be approximated by splitting them
into their element-wise contributions. The element volume integral can then
be easily computed by numerical integration using Gaussâ€“Legendre quadrature.

The respective $L_1$ and $L_2$ norms for the pressure error can be evaluated via
\[
||e_p||_1 = \sum_{i=1}^{n_e} \sum_{q=1}^{n_q} |e_p({\bm r}_q)| w_q |J_q|
\quad\quad
\quad\quad
||e_p||_2=\sqrt{ \sum_{i=1}^{n_e} \sum_{q=1}^{n_q} |e_p({\bm r}_q)|^2 w_q |J_q| }
\]
where
\[
e_p({\bm r}_q)=p({\bm r}_q) - p^{th}({\bm r}_q)
\]
is the pressure error evaluated at the $q$th quadrature associated with
the $i$th element. $n_e$ and $n_q$ refer to the number of elements and
the number of quadrature points per element.
$w_q$ and $J_q$ are the quadrature weight of the Jacobian associated with
point $q$.

The velocity error $e_v$ is evaluated using the following two norms
\[
||e_v||_1 = \sum_{i=1}^{n_e} \sum_{q=1}^{n_q} [ |e_u({\bm r}_q)| + |e_v({\bm r}_q)| ]    w_q |J_q|
\quad\quad
\quad\quad
||e_v||_2=\sqrt{ \sum_{i=1}^{n_e} \sum_{q=1}^{n_q} \left[ |e_u({\bm r}_q)|^2 +  e_v({\bm r}_q)|^2 \right] w_q |J_q| }
\]
where
\[
e_u({\bm r}_q)=u({\bm r}_q) - u^{th}({\bm r}_q)
\quad\quad
\quad\quad
e_v({\bm r}_q)=v({\bm r}_q) - v^{th}({\bm r}_q)
\]
We compute the different error norms for $e_p$ and $e_v$ for a set of numerical experiments with
varying resolution $h$. We expect the error norms to follow the following relationships:
\[
||e_v||_1 = C h^{r_v} \quad\quad\quad ||e_v||_2 = C h^{r_v'}
\]
\[
||e_p||_1 = C h^{r_p} \quad\quad\quad ||e_p||_2 = C h^{r_p'}
\]
where $C$ is a resolution-independent constant
and $r_p$, $r_p'$ and $r_v$, $r_v'$ are the convergence rates for
pressure and velocity, respectively. Using linear regression
on the logarithm of the respective error norm and the resolution,
we compute the convergence rates of the numerical solutions.

\begin{itemize}
\item For $Q_1P_0$, the theoretical lower bound for $r_v'$ is 2 and for $r_p'$ it is 1
\item For $Q_2P_{-1}$, the theoretical lower bound for $r_v'$ is 3 and for $r_p'$ it is 2
\end{itemize}

We note that when using discontinuous pressure space
(e.g., $P_0$, $P_{-1}$), these bounds remain valid even
when the viscosity is discontinuous provided that the element boundaries conform to the discontinuity.
