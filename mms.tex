\index{MMS} \index{method of manufactured solutions}

The method of manufactured solutions is a relatively simple way of carrying out
code verification. In essence, one postulates a solution for the PDE at hand (as
well as the proper boundary conditions), inserts it in the PDE and computes the 
corresponding source term. 
The same source term and boundary conditions will then be used in a numerical 
simulation so that the computed solution can be compared with the (postulated)
true analytical solution. 

Examples of this approach are to be found in \cite{dohu,busa13,dodg06}.
