Before we start with the basics of the Finite Difference method, we should quickly recall the definition 
of the derivative of a function. 

\begin{center}
{\sl 
The derivative of a function $y=f(x)$ of a variable $x$ is a measure of the rate at which the value $y$ 
of the function changes with respect to the change of the variable $x$. It is called the derivative of $f$ 
with respect to $x$. If $x$ and $y$ are real numbers, and if the graph of $f$ is plotted against $x$, the derivative 
is the \underline{slope} of this graph at each point. 
}
\end{center}

\noindent There are two standard notations:
\[
\frac{df}{dx}(x) \qquad \text{and} \qquad f'(x)
\]
The mathematical definition is\footnote{if the limit exists}:
\[
\boxed{
f'(x)
=\lim_{h\rightarrow 0} \frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{(x+h)-x} 
=\lim_{h\rightarrow 0} \frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h} 
}
\]

\end{center}

Also, one can rewrite the formula above as
\[
f(x+h) \simeq f(x) +  f'(x) h
\]
which is in fact the beginning of the Taylor expansion of the function:
\[
f(x+h) \simeq f(x) +  f'(x) h + \frac{1}{2!} f''(x) h^2 + \dots 
\]
We will see in what follows that the Taylor expansion and the concept of derivative lies 
central in the Finite Difference method.
