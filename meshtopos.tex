Right: Taken from Gresho \& Sani's book \cite{grsa}: "For fans of $Q_1Q_0$ who want 
guaranteed optimal convergence of both u and p (with however larger error 
constants caused by the distorted shapes?), one way to assure this is
to discretise via the macro elements above, each composed of five $Q_1Q_0$
quadrilaterals. Such checkerboard-killer meshes have been employed in practice
by (at least) Bath\'e \cite{chba93}. Both the macro-element and the proof are
due to Stenberg \cite{sten84}."}

this behavior was proven analytically (see Brezzi \& Fortin \cite{brfo}, see also Le Tallec \& Ruas \cite{leru86}).}

This macro-element has been proven stable in \cite{leta81,leru86}, i.e. it satisfies 
the stability condition (see Section~\ref{ss:pair}).
It is also mentioned in \cite{qizh07}.

\subsubsection{The Qin \& Zhang macro-elements}

In their paper \cite{qizh07} the authors mention the above two macro-elements 
and also introduce three new ones:

\begin{center}

\end{center}

They also indicate that although stable, these macro-elements are inferior 
to the above two.

\subsubsection{New macro-elements ?}

\end{center}

I came up with these, no idea whether these are stable/usable or better than the others.
