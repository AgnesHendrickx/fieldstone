\item Write about

  \begin{itemize}
  \item harmonic spectrum , see \cite{ribr99}
  \item write about impose bc on el matrix
  \item write about stream functions 
  \item write section in features about thermo mechanical simulations and how/why we solve vp, then T.
  \item write Scott about matching compressible2 setup with his paper

  \item write about splines as basis functions \cite{chri92}. second or third order basis functions , using extra nodes instead of using more nodes per element. 
  Smaller matrix than Q2 or Q3 but: spline coeffs on nodes are no more unknowns. Plus bc are complicated. Does it work well with visc contrasts ?
  \item write about jacobian tensor and norm for Q1 rectangles. and more ?
  \item write about Courant nb

\subsection{Open questions}

\begin{itemize}
\item what does it mean to have a negative pressure ? should we threshold it when computing yield strength ? 
\item Why pressure bc works for Q2Q1 but not Q1P0 ??
\item is there a formal definition of shape fct, trial fct, basis fct vs test fct 
\item is there an efficient manner to start from (say) quadrilateral mesh defined by corners only, choose an 
order $n$ corresponding to $Q_n \times Q_{n-1}$ and generate nodes without doubles?
\item where in the maths does it say that I cannot prescribe a T for an outgoing flow boundary?
