\paragraph{Isentropic gradient}

The material properties also define the slope of the adiabat (the change in temperature with
pressure at constant entropy) at all pressures and temperatures. Using the cyclic relation,
we can define this slope in terms of partial differentials of the entropy with respect to pressure
and temperature:
\begin{eqnarray}
\left( \frac{\partial T}{\partial p} \right)_{S} 
&=& - \left( \frac{\partial T}{\partial S} \right)_{p} \left( \frac{\partial S}{\partial p} \right)_{T} \\
&=& - \left( \frac{T}{C_p} \right) \left( - \frac{\alpha}{\rho} \right) \\
&=& \frac{\alpha T}{\rho C_p} \label{eq:mm_isentropic_gradient}
\end{eqnarray}
This expression does not pose a constraint on the material properties, but in order to be 
self-consistent, the adiabat must be computed following this relation.

For complex material models, obtaining analytical functions which obey all these relations
may be a non-trivial exercise. Furthermore, it is often not immediately clear when a
given formulation is thermodynamically inconsistent. Indeed, both the
thermodynamic and the geodynamic literature contain many equations of
state and material parameterizations which do not obey these 
relations! This may not invalidate the results obtained with these 
models, but it is a point worth keeping in mind as the geodynamics
community moves to more complicated and more realistic parameterizations.

\emph{A final note of warning: Some compressible formulations in \aspect{}
  (Section~\ref{sec:mass-conservation-approximation}) use the isothermal compressibility,
  while others use the isentropic compressibility. Fully self-consistent material models must
  either specify what approximation of the compressible equations they are consistent with
  (see Section~\ref{sec:approximate-equations}), or have a switch so that they use the correct
  compressibility for each of the different approximations. The conversion between isothermal
  and isentropic compressibilities is given in~\eqref{eq:mm_isentropic_compressibility}.}

\paragraph{Initial conditions and the adiabatic pressure/temperature}

The thermo-mechanically coupled (Navier-)Stokes 
equations require us to
pose initial conditions for the temperature
Note that the equations
themselves do not require that initial conditions are specified for
the velocity and pressure variables (since there are no time
derivatives on these variables in the model).

Nevertheless, a nonlinear solver will have difficulty converging to
the correct solution if we start with a completely unphysical pressure
for models in which coefficients such as density $\rho$ and viscosity
$\eta$ depend on the pressure and temperature. To this end, \aspect{}
uses pressure and temperature fields $p_{\textrm{ad}}(z),
T_{\textrm{ad}}(z)$ computed in the adiabatic conditions model
(see Section~\ref{parameters:Adiabatic_20conditions_20model}).
By default, these fields satisfy adiabatic conditions:
\begin{align}
\rho C_p \frac{\textrm{d}}{\textrm{d}z} T_{\textrm{ad}}(z)
&=
\frac{\partial\rho}{\partial T} T_{\textrm{ad}}(z) g_z,
\\
\frac{\textrm{d}}{\textrm{d}z} p_{\textrm{ad}}(z)
&=
\rho g_z,
\end{align}
where strictly speaking $g_z$ is the magnitude of the vertical
component of the gravity vector field, but in practice we take the
magnitude of the entire gravity vector.

These equations can be integrated numerically starting at $z=0$, using
the depth dependent gravity field and values of the coefficients
$\rho=\rho(p,T,z), C_p=C_p(p,T,z)$. As starting conditions at $z=0$ we
choose a pressure $p_{\textrm{ad}}(0)$ equal to the average surface
pressure (often chosen to be zero, see Section~\ref{sec:pressure}),
and an adiabatic surface temperature $T_{\textrm{ad}}(0)$ that is
also selected in the input parameter file.

\note{The adiabatic surface temperature is often chosen significantly
  higher than the actual surface temperature. For example, on earth,
  the actual surface temperature is on the order of 290 K, whereas a
  reasonable adiabatic surface temperature is maybe 1600 K. The reason
  is that the bulk of the mantle is more or less in thermal equilibrium
  with a thermal profile that corresponds to the latter temperature,
  whereas the very low actual surface temperature and the very high
  bottom temperature at the core-mantle boundary simply induce a
  thermal boundary layer. Since the temperature and pressure profile
  we compute using the equations above are simply meant to be good
  starting points for nonlinear solvers, it is important to choose
  this profile in such a way that it covers most of the mantle well;
  choosing an adiabatic surface temperature of 290 K would yield a
  temperature and pressure profile that is wrong almost throughout the
  entire mantle.}

For instance, let us consider $\alpha=3\cdot 10^{-5}$, 
$g_z=10$, $C_p=1250$, $\rho=\rho_0(1-\alpha (T-T_0)$ so that 
$\frac{\partial\rho}{\partial T} = -\alpha \rho_0$ 
with $\rho_0=3300$.

Then we must solve the following equation
\[
\rho_0(1-\alpha(T-T_0)) C_p \frac{\textrm{d}T}{\textrm{d}z} 
=
- \alpha T^2  g_z
\]

----------------------------------

In Verhoogen (1951) \cite{verh51}:
As is well known, the adiabatic gradient may be written as
\[
\frac{dT}{dP} = \alpha T /\rho C_p
\]
If hydrostatic equilibrium is assumed, the pressure varies with depth $h$ as 
$dP = \rho g dh$, so that
\[
\frac{d \ln T}{dh} = \frac{\alpha g}{C_p}
\]
from which the temperature $T$ at any depth $h$ may be computed as a function of the temperature
at any assigned depth if the ratio $\alpha/C_p$ 
is known at all depths ($g$, the acceleration of gravity, will
be taken as constant in the mantle).

From DyMaLi: In the interior of a convecting medium temperatures follow an adiabatic profile. 
At the top and bottom of a convecting layer thermal boundary layers with large thermal gradients form. 
The interior is thermally well mixed and therefore essentially isothermal, with a slight increase 
of temperatures with depth due to the effect of pressure.
For example in the Earth’s mantle the geothermal gradient ∂T /∂z is about 20C/km near the 
surface and about 0.3C/km in the interior of the mantle. This small gradient in the 
interior is the adiabatic gradient. If a small
volume of material is moved to shallower depth is experiences a slight increase in volume 
due to the decreasing pressure and associated with this a slight decrease in temperature. 
This change in temperature is the adiabatic temperature change.

The adiabatic gradient can be determined from the thermodynamics relation between entropy per unit mass S,
temperature T, and pressure P:
\[
dS = \left( \frac{dS}{dT}\right)_P dT +  \left( \frac{dS}{dP}\right)_T dP
=
\frac{C_p }{T} dT - \frac{\alpha}{\rho} dP
\]
In case of a reversible adiabatic process the entropy change is zero, and so the adiabatic gradient is:
\[
\left( \frac{dT}{dP}\right)_S = \frac{\alpha T}{\rho C_p} 
\]
The gradient can also be expressed in terms of depth, remembering that $d p = \rho gdz$ 
in a hydrostatic fluid:
\[
\left( \frac{dT}{dz}\right)_S = \frac{\alpha g T}{C_p} 
\]
Thus to determine the adiabatic gradient one needs values of $\alpha$ 
and $C_p$ with depth. These are obtained from laboratory experiments.

One also needs an estimate of density as a function of depth, which is generally determined
from seismology. 
Integration of the adiabatic gradient in terms of pressure then gives
temperature as a function of pressure. 
Temperature as a function of depth is obtained by integrating the density
distribution to obtain g as a function of depth.

This adiabaticity hypothesis should, however, not
be taken too literally (Jeanloz and Morris, 1987 \cite{jemo87}). In
most numerical simulations, the resulting averaged
geotherm can be far (a few hundred kelvins) from
adiabatic (Bunge et al., 2001 \cite{burm01}). First, radioactive heat-
ing, dissipation, and diffusion are never totally
negligible, second, even if each fluid parcel follows
its own adiabatic geotherm, the average geotherm
may not correspond to any particular adiabat.
