write about recovering accurate strain rate components and heat flux components on the nodes.

Let $\vec g_f(\vec r)$  be the desired nodal 
field which we want to be the continuous $Q_1$ representation of the field $\vec \nabla f$.
Since the derivative of the shape function does not exist on the nodes we need to design
an algorithm do do so. There are various techniques, as listed hereafter.
