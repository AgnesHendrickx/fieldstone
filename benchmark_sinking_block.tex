The domain is a unit square. Fluids are such that 
$\rho_1=1$, $\eta_1=1$ and $\rho_2=1.01$, $\eta_2=1000$.
Boundary conditions are either free slip or no slip. 
Pressure is normalised so that the veloume average is zero. 
Gravity points downwards with $|\vec{g}|=1$.
Profile measurements are carried out on the dashed line.
