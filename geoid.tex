{\scriptsize Idealized 2D slab calculations for each viscosity model: geoid and geoid filtered 
to pass only the longest wavelengths ($\sim$ 4000 km).
(a) Cold slab extends to 500 km depth in the upper mantle, 
(b) Slab extends to 750 km so that it is partly supported by the high viscosity lower mantle at 670 km. 
(c) Slab tilted at 45\degree to the vertical extending to the top of the lower mantle.
