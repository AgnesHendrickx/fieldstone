The domain is a unit square. The fluid is characterised 
by $\rho=1$ and $\eta=1$ 
while the sphere is characterised 
by $\rho=2$ and $\eta=1000$.
The gravity vector is $\vec{g}=(0,-1)$. 
Boundary conditions are free slip on all sides.
Viscosity and density directly computed at the quadrature points.
