{\sl This fieldstone was developed in collaboration with Job Mos}.

From \cite{dohu}. In order to illustrate the behavior of selected mixed finite elements in the solution 
of stationary Stokes flow,  we consider a two-dimensional problem 
in the square domain $\Omega=[0,1]\times[0,1]$, which possesses a closed-form analytical 
solution. The problem consists of determining the velocity field ${\bm v} = (u,v)$ and the 
pressure $p$ such that 
\[
-\nu \Delta {\bm v} + {\bm \nabla} p = {\bm b}  \quad\quad {\rm in} \; \Omega
\]
\[
{\bm \nabla} \cdot {\bm v} = 0 \quad\quad {\rm in} \; \Omega
\]
\[
{\bm v}={\bm 0} \quad\quad {\rm on} \; \Gamma
\]
where the fluid viscosity is taken as $\nu=1$.

Quadratic convergence for velocity error, 
linear convergence for pressure error, as expected.

ToDo:

pressure normalisation?
