This benchmark is taken from \cite{dohu03} and is described fully in section \ref{mms}. 
In order to illustrate the behavior of selected mixed finite elements in the solution 
of stationary Stokes flow,  we consider a two-dimensional problem 
in the square domain $\Omega=[0,1]\times[0,1]$, which possesses a closed-form analytical 
solution. The problem consists of determining the velocity field $\vec{\upnu} = (u,v)$ and the 
pressure $p$ such that 
\[
\eta \Delta \vec\upnu - \vec{\nabla} p + \vec{b} = \vec{0}   \quad\quad {\rm in} \; \Omega
\]
\[
\vec{\nabla} \cdot \vec{\upnu} = 0 \quad\quad {\rm in} \; \Omega
\]
\[
\vec{\upnu}=\vec{0} \quad\quad {\rm on} \; \Gamma_D
\]
where the fluid viscosity is taken as $\eta=1$.
