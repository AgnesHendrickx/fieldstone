This benchmark is taken from Donea \& Huerta (2003) \cite{dohu03} and is described fully in section \ref{mms1}. 
In order to illustrate the behavior of selected mixed finite elements in the solution 
of stationary Stokes flow,  we consider a two-dimensional problem 
in the square domain $\Omega=[0,1]\times[0,1]$, which possesses a closed-form analytical 
solution.
