The details of the numerical setup are presented in Section \ref{mms1}.

Each element has $m_V=9$ vertices so in total $ndof_V\times m_V=18$ velocity dofs and 
$ndof_P*m_P=4$ pressure dofs. The total number of 
velocity dofs is therefore $NfemV=NV \times ndofV$ while the total number of
pressure dofs is $NfemP=NP\times ndofP$. The total number of dofs is then $Nfem=NfemV+NfemP$.

As a consequence, matrix $\K$ has size $NfemV,NfemV$ and matrix $\G$ has size $NfemV,NfemP$.
Vector $f$ is of size $NfemV$ and vector $h$ is of size $NfemP$.  

The pressure nullspace is removed in two different ways:
(i) by setting $p=p_{th}(L_x,L_y)=-1/6$ on the last node, or (ii)
by imposing (Lagrange multiplier) that $\int_\Omega p \; dV=0$.
