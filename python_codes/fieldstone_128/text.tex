Following chapter 10 of Guy Simpson's book \cite{simp17} the equations
governing the evolution of the fluid pressure and fluid flow velocities are\footnote{I have slightly changed the notations.}
\begin{eqnarray}
\varphi \beta \frac{\partial p}{\partial t} &=& -\vec\nabla \cdot \vec \upnu + H \label{eq:128:a}\\
\vec\upnu &=& -\frac{K}{\eta_f} (\vec\nabla p - \rho_f g \vec{e}_z) \label{eq:128:b}
\end{eqnarray}
where
\begin{itemize}
\item $p$ is the fluid pressure, 
\item $\vec\upnu$ is the fluid velocity vector, 
\item $\varphi$ is the porosity, 
\item $\beta$ is the bulk compressibility (\si{\per\pascal}), 
\item $K$ is the permeability (\si{\square\meter}), 
\item $\eta_f$ is the fluid viscosity (\si{\pascal\second}), 
\item $\rho_f$ is the water density (\si{\kg\per\cubic\meter}), 
\item $g$ is acceleration due to gravity (\si{\meter\per\square\second}), 
\item $\vec{e}$ is a unit vector oriented in the vertical direction, 
\item $H$ accounts for any fluid pressure sources or sinks (e.g., due to devolatilization reactions)
\end{itemize}
Introducing the excess pore fluid pressure defined as the pressure in excess of the hydrostatic pressure 
(i.e., $p_e = p-p_h$ where $p_h = \rho_f g (L_z-z)$) and 
substituting \eqref{eq:128:b} into \eqref{eq:128:a} lead to a single parabolic equation for
the excess fluid pressure as follows:
\begin{equation}
\varphi \beta  \frac{\partial p_e}{\partial t}
=
\vec\nabla \cdot \left( \frac{K}{\eta_f} \vec\nabla p_e  \right) + H
\end{equation}
Once the excess pressure is computed one can recover the fluid velocity via $\vec\upnu=-\frac{K}{\eta_f} \vec\nabla p_e$.

\subsection*{Fluid Flow Around a Fault}

%from simpson book
A porous crust with an initially uniform and isotropic permeability has an
overpressure that increases linearly with depth. At time = 0 a dipping, high permeability fault zone is
suddenly introduced into the crust.
The transient evolution of the excess pore pressure is governed by
\begin{equation}
\varphi \beta  \frac{\partial p_e}{\partial t}
=
\vec\nabla \cdot \left( \frac{K(x,y)}{\eta_f} \vec\nabla p_e  \right) + H
\end{equation}
subject to the boundary conditions as specified in the following figure:

\end{center}


The problem was solved with a total of 5248 triangles, 
a time step of 0.1 years, and the following physical parameters:
$K_{crust}=10^{-16}~\si{\square\meter}$ , 
$K_{fault}=10^{-12}~\si{\square\meter}$ , 
$\eta_f  = \SI{1.33e-4}{\pascal\second}$, 
$\beta=\SI{1e-10}{\per\pascal}$, and $\varphi=0.1$. 
The results, after an approximately steady situation has been achieved (after 10 years), show how the fluid overpressure
and fluid flow vectors in the crust are strongly perturbed by the presence of the high permeability
fault zone. Fluid is focused toward the base of the fault, while it diverges away from its upper tip.

The matlab code in the book relies on a bespoke mesh of linear triangles. Unfortunately the 
mesh is stored in a .mat format which is very inconvenient. In this \stone we rely on 
linear quadrilaterals instead. 

In what follows we use a $500\times 200$ mesh. Because of the geometry of the fault and the fact that we rely on 
a regular mesh, the fault is then represented as follows in the model:

The rest of the code is rather straight forward since it is a diffusion equation
(see for instance \stone 03). We carry out 100 timesteps of $\delta t=0.1~\si{\year}$ 
which is indeed enough time to reach a steady state. The recovered pressure and velocity fields 
are similar to those in the book but since the book's figure does not showcase a colorscale
we cannot quantitatively compare.
