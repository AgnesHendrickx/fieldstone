The domain is a unit square. The Stokes equations are not solved, the velocity is prescribed everywhere 
in the domain as follows:
\begin{eqnarray}
u&=&-(z-0.5)\\
v&=&0\\
w&=&(x-0.5)
\end{eqnarray}

At the moment, velocity is computed on the marker itself (rk0 algorithm).
When markers are advected outside, they are arbitrarily placed at location (-0.0123,-0.0123).
