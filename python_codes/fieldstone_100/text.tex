Very high resolution topography datasets of Mars are available at 
\url{https://astrogeology.usgs.gov/search/details/Mars/GlobalSurveyor/MOLA/Mars_MGS_MOLA_DEM_mosaic_global_463m/cub}.
However the data format is not very convenient so Bart Root 
helped me out and exported the data to ascii format.

The file {\filenamefont MOLA\_1deg.txt} counts 64,800 lines, 
i.e. 360x180 points. Longitude values range from  
0.5 to 359.5 and latitudes from -89.5 to +89.5. 

The file {\filenamefont MOLA\_0.5deg.txt} counts 4 times as many lines, 
i.e. 720x360 points. Longitude values range from  
0.25 to 359.75 and latitudes from -89.75 to +89.75. 




We follow a similar approach as in \stone 97 and use the data to produce 
two vtu files, one on a 2D plane, one on a 3D sphere:
