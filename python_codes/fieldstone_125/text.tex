To quote Wikipedia\footnote{\url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voronoi_diagram}}:
``In mathematics, a Voronoi diagram is a partition of a plane into regions close to each of a given set of objects. 
In the simplest case, these objects are just finitely many points in the plane (called seeds, sites, or generators). 
For each seed there is a corresponding region, called a Voronoi cell, consisting of all points of the plane closer to 
that seed than to any other. The Voronoi diagram of a set of points is dual to its Delaunay triangulation. ''
