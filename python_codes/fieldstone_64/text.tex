Code at \url{https://github.com/cedrict/fieldstone/tree/master/python_codes/fieldstone_64}


In the examples here there are only 2 compositions. 
Each material/composition is characterised by its $\eta_{\{1,2\}}$, $\mu_{\{1,2\}}$. 
With $\delta t$ chosen, $Z_{\{1,2\}}$ and $\eta_{eff,\{1,2\}}$ can be computed.

C1 and C2 are initialised at startup by looping over Vnodes and assigning a value to $C_1$ 
and $C_2$ such that $C_1+C_2=1$. 

The quantity $\tau_{xx},\tau_{yy},\tau_{xy},\dot{\omega}_{xy}$ (denoted by oxy in the code) 
are nodal and initialised at startup
(they are needed for the Stokes matrix):
\begin{lstlisting}
tauxx =np.zeros(NV,dtype=np.float64)  
tauyy =np.zeros(NV,dtype=np.float64)  
tauxy =np.zeros(NV,dtype=np.float64)  
oxy   =np.zeros(NV,dtype=np.float64)  
etaeff=np.zeros(NV,dtype=np.float64)  
Z     =np.zeros(NV,dtype=np.float64)  
rho   =np.zeros(NV,dtype=np.float64)  
\end{lstlisting}

Structure of the code (the following bulletpoints are inside the time stepping loop):

\begin{itemize}
\item Nodal $\eta_{eff}$, $Z$ and $\rho$ values are computed as follows:
\begin{lstlisting}
for i in range(0,NV):
    etaeff[i]=C1[i]*etaeff1+C2[i]*etaeff2
    Z[i]     =C1[i]*Z1     +C2[i]*Z2
    rho[i]   =C1[i]*rho1   +C2[i]*rho2
\end{lstlisting}

\item Build Stokes matrix. 
Loop over elements, loop over integration points inside the element, and for 
each quadrature point:
\begin{eqnarray}
Z(\vec{r}_q) &=& \sum_{i=1}^{m_V} N_i^\upnu(\vec{r}_q) Z_i \\
\tau_{xx}(\vec{r}_q)&=& \sum_{i=1}^{m_V} N_i^\upnu(\vec{r}_q) \tau_{xx,i} \\
\tau_{yy}(\vec{r}_q)&=& \sum_{i=1}^{m_V} N_i^\upnu(\vec{r}_q) \tau_{yy,i} \\
\tau_{xy}(\vec{r}_q)&=& \sum_{i=1}^{m_V} N_i^\upnu(\vec{r}_q) \tau_{xy,i} \\
\eta_{eff}(\vec{r}_q)&=& \sum_{i=1}^{m_V} N_i^\upnu(\vec{r}_q) \eta_{eff,i} \\
\dot{\omega}_{xy}(\vec{r}_q) &=& \sum_{i=1}^{m_V} N_i^\upnu(\vec{r}_q)  \dot{\omega}_{xy,i} \\
\rho(\vec{r}_q) &=& \sum_{i=1}^{m_V} N_i^\upnu(\vec{r}_q) \rho_i 
\end{eqnarray}


The elastic memory rhs term is built following Eq.~(\ref{XXX}):
\begin{lstlisting}
R[0]=Zq*(tauxxq+dt*oxyq*(2*tauxyq))
R[1]=Zq*(tauyyq+dt*oxyq*(-2*tauxyq))
R[2]=Zq*(tauxyq+dt*oxyq*(tauyyq-tauxxq))
f_el-=b_mat.T.dot(R)*weightq*jcob
\end{lstlisting}

\item Solve system and obtain $u,v,p$

\item Compute nodal velocity gradient ${\bm L}=\vec\nabla\vec\upnu$

\item Compute derivated nodal fields 

\begin{lstlisting}
exx[:]=Lxx[:]
eyy[:]=Lyy[:]
exy[:]=0.5*(Lxy[:]+Lyx[:])
oxy[:]=0.5*(Lxy[:]-Lyx[:])
Jxx[:]=2*tauxx[:]*oxy[:]
Jyy[:]=-2*tauxy[:]*oxy[:]
Jxy[:]=(tauyy[:]-tauxx[:])*oxy[:]
\end{lstlisting}

\item (re-)build nodal ${\bm \tau}$: 
\begin{lstlisting}
tauxx=2*etaeff*exx+Z*tauxx+Z*dt*Jxx
tauyy=2*etaeff*eyy+Z*tauyy+Z*dt*Jyy
tauxy=2*etaeff*exy+Z*tauxy+Z*dt*Jxy
\end{lstlisting}

\item advect $C_1$, $C_2$, $\tau_{xx}$, $\tau_{yy}$ and $\tau_{xy}$ fields

\item produce vtu file

\end{itemize}









LIMITATIONS:

no RK algo for marker advection. but small timestep so ok ?

\paragraph{Stress build-up in viscoelastic Maxwell body}

The first benchmark performed to test the viscoelastic implementation considers the stress 
build-up present in a viscoelastic Maxwell body. Contrary to stressed viscous materials, 
viscoelastic materials gradually build-up stress when sheared after which a transition to viscous deformation occurs.  

An unstressed, incompressible viscoelastic Maxwell medium is subjected to a velocity field 
resulting in pure shear. 
The increase of the accumulated stress with time is given by an analytical solution:
\begin{equation}
{\bm \tau} = 2\eta\ {\dot{\bm \varepsilon}} \left ( 1-e^{-\frac{\mu }{\eta} t } \right )
\end{equation}
with $t$ time, $\eta$ the prescribed material viscosity and $\mu$ the prescribed material shear modulus. 
The domain size is 100$\times 100$km.
The velocity prescribed at all boundaries equals $v=1$ cm/yr in magnitude yielding a constant 
background strain rate of $\dot{\varepsilon}=2\text{cm/yr}/100\text{km}\simeq 6.342\times 10^{-15}$. 
The viscosity is $\eta= 10^{21}\text{Pa.s}$, the shear modulus is 
$\mu =10^{10}$Pa and the gravity is set to zero. We set $\delta t=100$yr.  

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=5cm]{python_codes/fieldstone_64/images/stress_buildup_setup.png}\\
\captionfont{
Set up of the stress build-up benchmark. All domain sides have a free slip
boundary condition, and pure shear velocity conditions are prescribed. Adapted from 
Gerya (2010) \cite{gery10}.} 
\end{center}

We have 
\[
\eta_{eff} 
= \frac{\eta \delta t}{\delta t + \eta/\mu} 
= \frac{10^{21} \cdot 3.154\times 10^{9}}{3.154\times 10^{9} + 10^{21}/10^{10}} 
\simeq 
3.057\times 10^{19}\text{Pa.s}
\qquad
\text{and}
\qquad
Z=\frac{\eta_{eff}}{\mu \delta t} 
\simeq 
0.9694
\]
The Maxwell time is $t_M = \frac{\eta}{\mu} = 10^{11}\text{s} \simeq 3171\text{yr}$.
In the absence of elasticity (purely viscous behaviour), we have 
$\dot{\varepsilon}_{xx} = 6.342\times 10^{-15}$ 
and $\eta=10^{21}$ so the 
deviatoric stress $\tau_{xx}$ is equal to 
\[
\tau_{xx} = 2 \cdot 10^{21} \cdot 6.342\times 10^{-15} \simeq 12.68 \times 10^6 \text{Pa}
\]

The first time that the Stokes system is solved, there is no stored stress, i.e. the 
elastic rhs is identically zero, so that the system is solved with a viscosity equal to
$\eta_{eff}$.
We can easily compute the analytical solution, and we see that $\dot{\varepsilon}_{xy}=0$
and $\dot{\omega}_{xy}=0$, which we recover:

\includegraphics[width=5cm]{python_codes/fieldstone_64/results/buildup/init/oxy}
\end{center}

The expected stress value for $\tau_{xx}$ is 
\[
\tau_{xx} = 2 \eta_{eff} \dot{\varepsilon}_{xx} 
= 2 \cdot 3.057\times 10^{19} \cdot 6.342\times 10^{-15} 
\simeq 38.775 \times 10^4 \text{Pa}
\]

\paragraph{Bending of elastic slab}

The sinking slab benchmark consists of a beam of elastic material which is placed 
in a weak and viscous surrounding medium. The initially unstressed beam is attached 
to the left domain boundary through boundary conditions. A stress is then applied to 
the beam in the form of gravity. The applied gravity force results in the deformation 
of the beam through bending. After 20 kyr, the gravity field is turned off and the 
elastic properties of the beam will then force itself to its original position.  
The set-up of the benchmark is given in the following figure: 

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=6cm]{python_codes/fieldstone_64/images/poster_benchmark.png}\\
\captionfont{Set-up of the benchmark from \cite{gery10}. The properties of the 
two materials are given on the left, together with the initial configuration of the benchmark.} 
\end{center}

The beam is surrounded by a low-density, low-viscosity and high shear modulus medium 
of which the specifications are given in  the following table.
The boundary conditions of the domain consist of a no slip condition at 
the left boundary where the slab is attached and free slip boundary conditions along all other sides. 
The results are calculated on a grid with a resolution of 50x50 elements containing 64 randomly 
distributed markers at startup.
The time step is set to $\delta t = 200yr$ (i.e. gravity is switched off after 100 time steps).

\paragraph{Stress build-up in viscoelastic Maxwell body}

This benchmark comes from Appendix B of Keller et al (2013) \cite{kemk13}.

The domain is $7.5\times5$km. A dominantly elastic beam is fixed to, and protrudes horizontally 
from the left wall of the model box. 
Surrounding the elastic beam is a viscous, but inelastic fluid. 
All boundaries are free slip, except for the left wall, which is set to no slip in 
order to keep the bending beam fixed to the wall. The beam has a higher density than the surrounding fluid and
thus will bend down elastically driven by gravity. After the beam has 
accumulated some elastic strain through bending down, gravity is switched off. 
If the stress evolution is implemented accurately, the elastic beam should now, 
free from the pull of gravity, move upwards again and restore its initial position. 

Material properties are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item beam: $\rho=1500$, $\eta=10^{24}$, $\mu=10^{10}$
\item fluid: $\rho=1000$, $\eta=10^{18}$, $\mu=10^{11}$
\end{itemize}

This choice of parameters leads to a Maxwell time 
$t_m = 0.32$ yr for the background fluid and Maxwell times of 
$t_m = 3.2$ Myr for the beam, meaning that the deformation in this benchmark problem, 
which occurs on a timescale of thousands to a million years, 
will lead to dominantly viscous deformation in the fluid, 
and dominantly elastic behaviour of the beam. 

Keller et al set the numerical resolution to $300\times200$ elements, 
with 16 markers per elements for stress advection. Such a resolution is 
not feasible with our simple python implementation so the resolution is
then set to $96\times64$. 

The following plot comes from \cite{kemk13}:
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=14cm]{python_codes/fieldstone_64/images/kemk13}
\end{center}

The elastic timestep is set to $\delta t_e=100$yr and the tectonic timestep is set to the same value.
This yields $\eta_{eff}=10^{18}$ in the fluid, and $\eta_{eff}\simeq 3.15\times 10^{19}$.
After 50kyr, the gravity ($|\vec{g}|=10$) is switched off and the model is ran for another 
500kyr.

\end{center}

The value of $\eta_1=\eta_2=10^{35}$ for the elastic materials was obtained through personal communication. 
The value of $\mu_3=10^{50}$ for the viscous material ensures that $\eta_{eff}=\eta_3$.
Note that in the publication the authors test both compressible and incompressible 
formulations, but we restrict ourselves to incompressible results since our code cannot handle compressible behavior. 
I also use dt=5year.

The authors report a converged total relief of 306-308m:

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=8cm]{python_codes/fieldstone_64/images/chtl13b}
\end{center}

This benchmark requires either a sticky air layer (see Section~\ref{sss:stickyair})
on top of the plate or a deformable mesh (ALE formulation, see Section~\ref{sss:ale}).

Under are shown the minimum and maximum vertical velocity measurements
which as expected converge to zero (thereby indicating that a steady state 
solution is being reached) and the plot of the free surface 
topography.

DISCLAIMER: there is no ALE formulation implemented yet. I can therefore only run the experiment for 1 time step:
