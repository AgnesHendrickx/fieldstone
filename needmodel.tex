The governing equations we have seen in this chapter require the use 
of numerical solution techniques for three main reasons:
\begin{itemize}
\item the advection term in the energy equation couples velocity and temperature;
\item the constitutive law (the relationship between stress and strain rate) 
often depends on velocity (or rather, strain rate), temperature, pressure, ...
\item Even when the coefficients of the PDE's are linear, often their spatial
variability, coupled to potentially complex domain geometries prevent 
arriving at the analytical solution.
\end{itemize}

Also we often have to deal with additional challenges:
\begin{itemize}
\item Complex geometries
\item Multiphysics 
\item Many scales in space and time
\end{itemize}


Note that in CFD one makes a distinction between verification and validation. 
Simply put \cite{roac97}:
\begin{itemize}
\item verification: "solving the equations right"
\item validation: "solving the right equations"
\end{itemize}
